		<h1>The Founder</h1>
		<p>The home is run by Mr and Mrs Steven, the founder of The Lighthouse Children's Welfare Home, who have given up their respective jobs to become full-time foster parents to all the children. </p>
		<p>Mrs Steven, 64, is a trained Child education professional, specialised in pre-school children's education. She has worked 13 years with children in pre-schools before retiring to care full-time for her enlarged family</p>
		<p>Mr Steven, 67, used to work in the banking and insurance sector, but quit is job many years ago to support the logistics of activities carried-out at the Lighthouse, and to be the best possible loving father for his children. 
		He used to work as a school bus driver but following an injury due to a fall he no longer has income from this source to support the home.</p>
